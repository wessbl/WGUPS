# The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine the best route and delivery distribution
# for their Daily Local Deliveries. The Salt Lake City DLD route has two trucks & drivers, and an average of 40
# packages to deliver each day; each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.
#
# This code presents a solution delivering all 40 packages, listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File,” on time,
# according to their criteria while reducing the total number of miles traveled by the trucks. The “Salt Lake City
# Downtown Map,” provides the location of each address, and the “WGUPS Distance Table” provides the distance between
# each address.
#
# The user can check the status of any given package at any given time using package IDs, including the delivery times,
# which packages are at the hub, and which are en route. The intent is to use this program for this specific location
# and to use the same program in different cities as WGUPS expands its business.

# Reorder function: The essential algorithm of the project. Called by the simulate function, defines the routes that
# trucks will take to deliver packages, and returns to the simulation.
def reorder(trucks, packages):
    return  # TODO delete


# * * * * *   Simulate Function   * * * * * #
# Simulates the WGUPS workday, printing package status updates between 2 given times. This function
# is the "clock" of the simulation, its only logic is to make sure the timeline is correct. Other functions are used for
# the actual algorithm
def simulate(status_time):
    print("\n\n\nPrint statuses at ", status_time)
    # Instantiate all variables
    trucks = [Truck(1, list()), Truck(2, {})]

    load_pkgs(pkgs)

# TODO Check if there are (or will be?) packages not loaded on a truck
# TODO If so, plan on delivering early-ETA packages first, then fill in the time gaps with as many packages as possible

# (Project Requirement): Provide an interface for the insert and look-up functions to view the status of any
# package at any time. This function should return all information about each package, including delivery status.
#   1.  Provide screenshots to show package status of all packages at a time between 8:35 a.m. and 9:25 a.m.
#   2.  Provide screenshots to show package status of all packages at a time between 9:35 a.m. and 10:25 a.m.
#   3.  Provide screenshots to show package status of all packages at a time between 12:03 p.m. and 1:12 p.m.
